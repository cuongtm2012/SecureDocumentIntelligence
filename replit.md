# Secure Document Intelligence System

## Overview

This is a sophisticated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) document processing system specifically designed for Vietnamese language support. The application combines modern web technologies with advanced OCR capabilities to provide secure document intelligence processing with multi-level clearance systems and comprehensive audit logging.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for development/build tooling
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components for consistent design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **PDF Handling**: PDF.js integration for document viewing and processing
- **Component Structure**: Modular component architecture with reusable UI components

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured endpoints for document processing
- **File Handling**: Multer middleware for file uploads with validation
- **Security**: Helmet for security headers, JWT for authentication

### Microservices Architecture
- **Python OCR Service**: Dedicated FastAPI microservice for OCR processing
- **Service Communication**: HTTP-based communication between Node.js and Python services
- **Port Configuration**: Main app on port 5000, Python OCR service on port 8001
- **Container Support**: Docker compose setup for production deployment

## Key Components

### Document Processing Pipeline
1. **File Upload**: Multi-format support (PDF, JPG, PNG) with drag-and-drop interface
2. **OCR Processing**: Vietnamese language-optimized text extraction using Tesseract
3. **Text Cleaning**: AI-powered text correction and normalization
4. **Structured Data Extraction**: Intelligent parsing of document fields
5. **Export Capabilities**: Multiple output formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX)

### OCR Enhancement Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Primary Vietnamese with English fallback
- **Batch Processing**: Queue-based processing for multiple documents
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quality assessment for extracted text
- **Split-screen Viewer**: Side-by-side document and text display
- **Real-time Updates**: Live processing status and progress tracking

### Security & Audit System
- **User Management**: Multi-level clearance system (Level 1-3)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all user actions
- **File Security**: Secure file storage with access controls
- **Session Management**: JWT-based authentication with session handling

## Data Flow

### Upload and Processing Flow
1. User uploads document via web interface
2. File validation and security checks performed
3. Document stored in secure upload directory
4. OCR processing request sent to Python microservice
5. Text extraction and Vietnamese language processing
6. Results stored in database with confidence metrics
7. Real-time updates sent to frontend via API polling

### Database Operations
- **Document Metadata**: File information, processing status, timestamps
- **OCR Results**: Extracted text, confidence scores, structured data
- **User Activity**: Authentication logs, document access history
- **Audit Trail**: Complete action logging for compliance requirements

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract with Vietnamese language pack
- **PDF Processing**: PDF.js for frontend, pdf-parse for backend
- **Image Processing**: Sharp for image optimization
- **AI Integration**: DeepSeek API for enhanced text processing

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with TypeScript compilation
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM (configurable for PostgreSQL)
- **Container**: Docker with multi-service orchestration
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for integration tests

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Python**: Version 3.11 with OCR libraries
- **Tesseract**: OCR engine with Vietnamese language data
- **Poppler**: PDF to image conversion utilities

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Setup**: npm run dev for hot reloading
- **Service Management**: Concurrent running of Node.js and Python services
- **Port Proxy**: Vite proxy configuration for API communication
- **Debug Tools**: Comprehensive logging and error handling

### Production Deployment
- **Container Strategy**: Multi-container Docker setup
- **Service Discovery**: Internal network communication between containers
- **Load Balancing**: Configurable for horizontal scaling
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for all services

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local SQLite database with mock OCR fallbacks
- **Production**: PostgreSQL database with full OCR capabilities
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment with volume mounting
- **Replit**: Cloud deployment with auto-scaling support
